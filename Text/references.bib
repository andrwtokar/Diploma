abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) human pose estimation involves estimating the articulated 3D joint locations of a human body from an image or video. Due to its widespread applications in a great variety of areas, such as human motion analysis, humanâ€“computer interaction, robots, 3D human pose estimation has recently attracted increasing attention in the computer vision community, however, it is a challenging task due to depth ambiguities and the lack of in-the-wild datasets. A large number of approaches, with many based on deep learning, have been developed over the past decade, largely advancing the performance on existing benchmarks. To guide future development, a comprehensive literature review is highly desired in this area. However, existing surveys on 3D human pose estimation mainly focus on traditional methods and a comprehensive review on deep learning based methods remains lacking in the literature. In this paper, we provide a thorough review of existing deep learning based works for 3D pose estimation, summarize the advantages and disadvantages of these methods and provide an in-depth understanding of this area. Furthermore, we also explore the commonly-used benchmark datasets on which we conduct a comprehensive study for comparison and analysis. Our study sheds light on the state of research development in 3D human pose estimation and provides insights that can facilitate the future design of models and algorithms.}

abstract = {Gait analysis has now advanced to the point where it is used as a routine part of patient management in certain centers. It is best thought of as a special investigation, which is used together with the history, physical examination and other special investigations to perform a detailed assessment of a patient with a walking disorder. Clinical gait analysis usually consists of 5 elements: videotape examination, measurement of general gait parameters, kinematic analysis, kinetic measurement, and electromyography (EMG). Kinematic measurements are usually made by television cameras, linked into a computer, which define the movements of the major joints of the lower limb in 3 dimensions. The primary kinetic measurement is that of the force beneath each foot while walking. By combining kinematic and kinetic data, it is possible to calculate the joint moments and powers, again in 3 dimensions. The joint angle, moment and power, and the EMG from specific muscles, provide a detailed description of the mechanics of gait. Such information enables much better decisions to be reached on the best way to treat the patient. The primary diagnosis which can be aided by gait analysis is cerebral palsy, but the technique is also useful in a number of other conditions.}
